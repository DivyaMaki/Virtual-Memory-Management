# Virtual-Memory-Management
A C++ - based simulation of page replacement algorithms (FIFO, LRU, and Optimal) with a graphical user interface built using GTK+. This project visualizes memory management concepts, including page tables, main memory, and secondary memory, while tracking page hits and faults. Ideal for educational purposes in operating systems courses.
